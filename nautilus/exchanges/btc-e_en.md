BTC-e is one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges still in business, and is still one of the most popular with traders due to its generally lower BTC prices, active chatroom, greater privacy, and selection of trading pairs. Balances are available in multiple national and digital currencies including USD, EUR, Russian rubles, litecoin, novacoin and namecoin (which can be traded in various pairs). 

The exchange itself is a simple limit-order exchange, with no margin trading or leverage.
 
BTC-e is unique among major bitcoin exchanges in that it does not require real names or a know-your-customer (KYC) identification process for trading accounts. An email address and password are the only requirements. Little is known about the identities of its operators or location of operations, which is believed to be in Cyprus and/or Eastern Europe. 

Despite BTC-e's looser compliance standards, the exchange has performed reliably for years. It also allows withdrawal (with conditions) by wire transfer, PayPal, OKPay, Mastercard/Visa and other payment processors. Deposits are by wire transfer and non-PayPal processors.
