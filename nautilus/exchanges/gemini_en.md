Announced in January 2015 and launched in October that year, Gemini is the much-anticipated trading platform of internet entrepreneurs and bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. 

Gemini filed with the NYDFS to become a [limited liability trust company](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204734485-Is-Gemini-a-licensed-and-regulated-exchange-) (under the same conditions as itBit) in order to become only the second New York-based exchange since that state introduced special 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin businesses.

The company is positioning itself as a bitcoin exchange for high net worth and institutional clients, touting its security, compliance and (limited) access to FDIC deposit protection for users' fiat balances. 

Gemini offers a USD-BTC exchange with standard professional trading features, plus API access for high-frequency trading. It does not offer margin trading or derivatives.

Only customers in [certain states](https://blog.gemini.com/geminis-area-of-operation/) may use the platform, and the company is in negotiations with other state regulators with a view to including them in future.
