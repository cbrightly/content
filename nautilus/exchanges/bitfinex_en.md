Bitfinex launched in 2013 â€“ it is operated by a BVI-registered company with its primary banking partner in Taiwan. Within a year it had become one of the world's busiest bitcoin trading platforms.

Bitfinex offers spot trading, margin trading with up to 3.3x leverage, and margin funding (which allows depositors to 'lend' their bitcoins to margin traders to earn interest). The fee scale correlates to a user's trading volume. Trading currencies are USD, bitcoin and litecoin, with trading between either two supported. Users' digital funds are stored in separate, multi-signature wallets (in partnership with BitGo) to avoid the vulnerability of one big exchange wallet and allow users to verify funds at any time.

In August 2015 Kraken (and Bitfinex) [announced](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-and-bitstamp-cut-services-in-new-york/) they could no longer serve customers in New York State, due to its new 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin companies.
