###[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) (Asia)###

Bitfinex launched in 2013 – it is operated by a BVI-registered company with its primary banking partner in Taiwan. Within a year it had become one of the world's busiest bitcoin trading platforms.

Bitfinex offers spot trading, margin trading with up to 3.3x leverage, and margin funding (which allows depositors to 'lend' their bitcoins to margin traders to earn interest). The fee scale correlates to a user's trading volume. Trading currencies are USD, bitcoin and litecoin, with trading between either two supported. Users' digital funds are stored in separate, multi-signature wallets (in partnership with BitGo) to avoid the vulnerability of one big exchange wallet and allow users to verify funds at any time.

In August 2015 Kraken (and Bitfinex) [announced](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-and-bitstamp-cut-services-in-new-york/) they could no longer serve customers in New York State, due to its new 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin companies.

###[Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) (EU)###

Slovenia-based Bitstamp first rose to prominence in late 2013, when it overtook the floundering Mt Gox as the world's busiest bitcoin exchange. It is still one of the most popular worldwide.

In January 2015 it suffered a hacking attack in which it lost 19,000 BTC, but quickly came back online with enhanced security features, and no customers lost funds. 

[Bitstamp offers](https://www.bitstamp.net/faq/) basic market and limit orders, with a fee grade depending on customer history and volumes traded. There are also small fees for non-bitcoin deposits, withdrawals, and fiat currency conversion. Despite its European location, trading is between USD and BTC or XRP (Ripple). 

Deposits are made via SEPA (if within the EU) or bank transfer if outside, and all amounts are converted to USD. Customers must verify their accounts by completing KYC procedures before accessing any of the exchange features.

Bitstamp has also experimented with creative deposit and withdraw options. EU-based customers can opt to withdraw funds in physical gold, while those in UK, Germany, Italy and Slovenia may purchase bitcoins using a credit card.

###[BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/)### 

BTC-e is one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges still in business, and is still one of the most popular with traders due to its generally lower BTC prices, active chatroom, greater privacy, and selection of trading pairs. Balances are available in multiple national and digital currencies including USD, EUR, Russian rubles, litecoin, novacoin and namecoin (which can be traded in various pairs). 

The exchange itself is a simple limit-order exchange, with no margin trading or leverage.
 
BTC-e is unique among major bitcoin exchanges in that it does not require real names or a know-your-customer (KYC) identification process for trading accounts. An email address and password are the only requirements. Little is known about the identities of its operators or location of operations, which is believed to be in Cyprus and/or Eastern Europe. 

Despite BTC-e's looser compliance standards, the exchange has performed reliably for years. It also allows withdrawal (with conditions) by wire transfer, PayPal, OKPay, Mastercard/Visa and other payment processors. Deposits are by wire transfer and non-PayPal processors.

###[Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/) (USA, EU)###

Coinbase is the most popular bitcoin exchange, wallet and point-of-sale operator in the USA and world in general, though its services differ between countries and US states according to regulation. It began in 2012 in San Francisco as a simple market-price brokerage service for US customers, allowing them to connect customer accounts to regular bank accounts. It has raised over $106m in funding to date.

It now offers accounts to customers in 32 countries, with trading in USD, EUR, GBP, CAD and SGD. 26 of those countries can buy bitcoins with credit and debit cards, without the need for a bank transfer. It also offers the 'Shift' card to US customers, allowing them to withdraw BTC funds directly to a Visa Debit card.

Accounts held in Coinbase wallets are insured (the company says it is insured for enough to also cover bitcoin balances). 

In January 2015 it [launched](https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/01/26/coinbase-launches-first-regulated-bitcoin-exchange/) 'Coinbase Exchange', a more fully-featured exchange aimed at professional traders, allowing market and limit orders, and algorithmic trading.

Its 'maker-taker' fee model means limit orders are free, while market orders (immediately filled) are charged fees according to users? trading volumes.

Coinbase provides a range of additional services aimed to increase liquidity and encourage development, such as 'instant exchange' for quick payments from any currency, 'instant buyback' to automatically replenish spent bitcoins, and mobile apps.

###[Gemini](https://gemini.com/) (USA)###

Announced in January 2015 and launched in October that year, Gemini is the much-anticipated trading platform of internet entrepreneurs and bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. 

Gemini filed with the NYDFS to become a [limited liability trust company](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204734485-Is-Gemini-a-licensed-and-regulated-exchange-) (under the same conditions as itBit) in order to become only the second New York-based exchange since that state introduced special 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin businesses.

The company is positioning itself as a bitcoin exchange for high net worth and institutional clients, touting its security, compliance and (limited) access to FDIC deposit protection for users' fiat balances. 

Gemini offers a USD-BTC exchange with standard professional trading features, plus API access for high-frequency trading. It does not offer margin trading or derivatives.

Only customers in [certain states](https://blog.gemini.com/geminis-area-of-operation/) may use the platform, and the company is in negotiations with other state regulators with a view to including them in future.

###[Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/) (PR China)### 

Huobi, along with OKCoin, regularly claim to be the most popular bitcoin trading platforms in the world by sheer volumes, which is often attributed to their fee-free trading structure and encouragement of algorithmic trading.

It offers spot trading in CNY, USD, BTC, and litecoin (for CNY traders only) with interfaces in Chinese and English, yet by far the largest percentage of trading is CNY-based. A fast-trading system called 'Flash Trade' is available for active traders. 

Huobi also operates a bitcoin/litecoin futures exchange known as BitVC, which also features the ability for users to lend digital currencies to margin traders to use as leverage (and earn interest).

The different regulatory environment in PR China means Huobi can offer a range of other bitcoin-based financial products not available elsewhere. These include Caimao, which uses bitcoins [as collateral](http://www.coindesk.com/huobi-will-now-take-your-bitcoins-as-stock-trading-collateral/) for stock trading, and altcoin (non-bitcoin cryptocurrency) trading platforms.

###[itBit](https://www.itbit.com/) (USA, Singapore)###

itBit launched in 2013 with the expressed aim of being a regulatory-compliant, professional trader-oriented bitcoin platform – in response to the poor reputation of bitcoin exchanges of the time such as Mt Gox and BitInstant. It was originally based in Singapore due to regulatory uncertainty in the USA. 

A management shakeup in July 2014 saw it move its primary headquarters to New York City, where it won a US Marshals Service auction for 3,000 bitcoins seized from Silk Road, did a $25m Series A funding deal and became the first bitcoin company to receive a trust company charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which offers asset protection and a higher level of financial reporting.

The company has always sought to hire staff and appoint advisors from the world of professional finance, law and government. In August 2015 it launched a new project called 'Bankchain', a non-bitcoin blockchain project aimed at the banking industry.

ItBit also offers an 'over the counter' (OTC) trading option for customers, enabling them to trade under certain limits outside the online platform.

###[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) (USA, EU, Japan)###

Although headquartered in San Francisco since 2011, Kraken is better known as an exchange for EUR (it is the world's highest-volume BTC-EUR exchange) and also offers trading in GBP, CAD, JPY and USD.  

The platform offers trading between cash, bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum – and between bitcoin and numerous other digital currencies including dogecoin, ripple and stellar.

It was also [appointed](http://www.coindesk.com/kraken-assist-search-missing-mt-gox-bitcoins/) by the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee in Japan to officially oversee the distribution of that company's remaining assets to creditors.

In August 2015 Kraken (and Bitfinex) [announced](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-and-bitstamp-cut-services-in-new-york/) they could no longer serve customers in New York State, due to its new 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin companies.

In January 2016, Kraken [announced](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160119005459/en) it would now serve customers in most US states and Canada (still excluding New York) with full bank access, after acquiring exchanges Coinsetter and Cavirtex.
