Although headquartered in San Francisco since 2011, Kraken is better known as an exchange for EUR (it is the world's highest-volume BTC-EUR exchange) and also offers trading in GBP, CAD, JPY and USD.  

The platform offers trading between cash, bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum â€“ and between bitcoin and numerous other digital currencies including dogecoin, ripple and stellar.

Kraken was the first bitcoin exchange to pass as cryptographic [proof-of-reserves audit](http://www.coindesk.com/krakens-audit-proves-holds-100-bitcoins-reserve/) (in 2014) and the first to have its trading data featured on Bloomberg Terminals. It was also [appointed](http://www.coindesk.com/kraken-assist-search-missing-mt-gox-bitcoins/) by the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee in Japan to officially oversee the distribution of that company's remaining assets to creditors.

In August 2015 Kraken (and Bitfinex) [announced](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-and-bitstamp-cut-services-in-new-york/) they could no longer serve customers in New York State, due to its new 'BitLicense' regulations for bitcoin companies.

In January 2016, Kraken [announced](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160119005459/en) it would now serve customers in most US states and Canada (still excluding New York) with full bank access, after acquiring exchanges Coinsetter and Cavirtex.
