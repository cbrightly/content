###[itBit](https://www.itbit.com/) (USA, Singapore)###

itBit launched in 2013 with the expressed aim of being a regulatory-compliant, professional trader-oriented bitcoin platform â€“ in response to the poor reputation of bitcoin exchanges of the time such as Mt Gox and BitInstant. It was originally based in Singapore due to regulatory uncertainty in the USA. 

A management shakeup in July 2014 saw it move its primary headquarters to New York City, where it won a US Marshals Service auction for 3,000 bitcoins seized from Silk Road, did a $25m Series A funding deal and became the first bitcoin company to receive a trust company charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which offers asset protection and a higher level of financial reporting.

The company has always sought to hire staff and appoint advisors from the world of professional finance, law and government. In August 2015 it launched a new project called 'Bankchain', a non-bitcoin blockchain project aimed at the banking industry.

ItBit also offers an 'over the counter' (OTC) trading option for customers, enabling them to trade under certain limits outside the online platform.
