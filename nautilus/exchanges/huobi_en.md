###[Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/) (PR China)### 

Huobi, along with OKCoin, regularly claim to be the most popular bitcoin trading platforms in the world by sheer volumes, which is often attributed to their fee-free trading structure and encouragement of algorithmic trading.

It offers spot trading in CNY, USD, BTC, and litecoin (for CNY traders only) with interfaces in Chinese and English, yet by far the largest percentage of trading is CNY-based. A fast-trading system called 'Flash Trade' is available for active traders. 

Huobi also operates a bitcoin/litecoin futures exchange known as BitVC, which also features the ability for users to lend digital currencies to margin traders to use as leverage (and earn interest).

The different regulatory environment in PR China means Huobi can offer a range of other bitcoin-based financial products not available elsewhere. These include Caimao, which uses bitcoins [as collateral](http://www.coindesk.com/huobi-will-now-take-your-bitcoins-as-stock-trading-collateral/) for stock trading, and altcoin (non-bitcoin cryptocurrency) trading platforms.
