## Average Volume Per Transaction

This chart tells you the average amount of BTC sent in each transaction. Looking at the 'All Time' chart, you can see there were far bigger spikes in earlier years, when bitcoin was worth less in dollars and transactions tended to be larger. There is still, however, the occasional large spike when someone sends an unusually high amount in a transaction.

It's important to remember this about bitcoin: whether someone sends one dollar to a friend or 10 million to the other side of the world, the network should process either transactions at the same speed and for the same fee.
