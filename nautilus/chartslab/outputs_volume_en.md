## Outputs Volume

### What are bitcoin 'inputs' and 'outputs'?#

Bitcoin 'inputs' and 'outputs' can be difficult to understand at first, but they're vital to the way bitcoin functions. The best way is to imagine a bitcoin wallet as a real physical wallet, full of bills and coins.

**Case 1:** You have to pay someone $50. In your wallet is a $20 bill, a $10 and four $5s. As you hand over all that cash, imagine those bills as your 'outputs'.

Now the person you paid has $50, and those bills become his/her 'inputs'. They may keep them for a while, spend them straight away, or send them to the bank. If kept, they could be called 'unspent outputs'. That's six bills all together, or six outputs, worth a total $50.

**Case 2:** You have to pay someone $10, but you only have one $50 bill. The other person takes the $50, and gives you $40 change. Your 'input' in this case is one $50 bill.

This transaction has different kinds of outputs. One is the $10 you gave to the other person, the other is the $40 they gave you back.

Bitcoin does not have physical bills. So that means there are 'output' amounts of all different sizes floating around out there, depending on how they were spent in the past. To make sure each transaction is the right amount, bitcoin wallet software needs to either break up large amounts, or combine smaller ones.

Your bitcoin wallet doesn't actually think in terms of total figures. It thinks about all your combined 'inputs' and 'outputs' and calculates their net worth, which it displays to you as a total. For a human, that's easier to understand.
