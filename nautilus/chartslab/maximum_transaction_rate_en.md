##  Maximum Transaction Rate

The maximum transaction rate is the block size limit divided by the average transaction size. For now, the block size limit is set to 1MB but the average transaction size can vary depending on the transaction type and its number of inputs or outputs.

The chart shows a drop in the maximum transaction rate from roughly 7-8 transactions per second in 2009 to roughly 3-4 transactions per second in 2015. This can be explained by the fact that transactions today group more inputs and outputs than before, resulting in heavier transactions. However, as the total output volume chart shows, the number of Bitcoin moved per day increase dramatically so today more money is moved with fewer transactions.

To give a rough estimate, VISA processes around 2,000 transaction per second and it has a peak capacity of 56,000 transactions per second while Paypal handles around 10 million transactions a year, resulting in 115 transactions per second. Huge efforts are deployed by the network community to uncap the maximum transaction rate and several propositions are under way to reach these levels.
