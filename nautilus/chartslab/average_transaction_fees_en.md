##Average Transaction Fees##

This chart shows the average amount paid (in millibitcoins, or mBTC) by senders in transaction fees to miners, per transaction.

Large spikes in the chart (1 BTC or more) are due to days when the network was especially busy, or errors. Particularly large spikes, such as those seen on the 'All Time' chart, are more likely due to error â€“ several users have accidentally mis-judged decimal places and paid way too much for their transaction. Modern consumer-grade bitcoin wallets usually handle the fees automatically, avoiding such mistakes.
