## Transaction Fees

This chart records the amount, in BTC, that bitcoin users have paid in transaction fees on a daily basis.

Transaction fees are expected to become more important in future, as the number of bitcoins awarded to mining operations per block is halved every four years. In order to keep the network secure, miners will one day rely on income from these fees as an incentive to keep their machines running.
