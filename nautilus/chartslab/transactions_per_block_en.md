## Transactions Per Block

This is simply the total number of bitcoin transactions recorded in each block, with each block representing roughly 10 minutes in bitcoin's lifespan.

Notice that the number begins to take off around late 2012/early 2013, around the point where mainstream media began talking about bitcoin. Around the same time, the price of one bitcoin began to rise noticeably beyond trivial amounts, on its way to several record-breaking highs that year.

The number of transactions per block also has relevance to: the size of transaction fees (higher may be necessary to guarantee prompt inclusion in a block), and the ongoing block size debate. [LINK]
