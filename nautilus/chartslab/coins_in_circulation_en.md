## Coins In Circulation

This chart shows the total number of bitcoins in circulation today. The Y-axis refers to millions of BTC that have already been mined. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and this number cannot be changed. The system was designed to mine more bitcoins early in its lifespan and gradually diminish over time, which is why over 2/3 of the 21 million total are already in circulation.

The final block that produces new bitcoins will be #6,929,999 – estimated to happen in the year 2140.

New blocks originally produced 50 BTC. Every four years, that number halves. It is currently 25 BTC. Next 'halving day' that number will drop to 12.5 BTC, and so on. The hope is that bitcoin value will increase over time, so miners can continue to earn money by keeping the network secure.

Even if a bitcoin 'exists', it may not be accessible. Millions of bitcoins have possibly been 'locked forever' due to lost keys and hard drives. Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to have around 1 million BTC in his wallets – and those bitcoins have never been touched. Therefore the 'real' final total bitcoins in circulation is likely to be far less than 21 million.
