##  Average Transaction Size

This is the average size, in kilobytes, of the transactions validated each day.

With this chart, you can get a good idea of the number of transactions which can fit into a block (which is limited to 1MB) and it gives an order of magnitude of the maximum number of transactions which can currently be processed by the network. For example, if the average transaction size is 0.5kB, roughly 1mB of transactions is processed every 10 minutes which results in an average 2,000 transactions every 10 minutes or 3.3 transactions per second.
