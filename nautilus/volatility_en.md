## What is volatility ?

This chart compares the volatility of Bitcoin prices with gold. Volatility is the magnitude of variation of the price of a financial asset. It gives a measure of the risk of investing in Bitcoin.

## What are the pricing sources ?

The [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) is used as source for the gold price, and Bitcoin's volatility is computed based on the Kaiko Bitcoin Price Index.

As the gold markets are closed on weekends and holidays, the 30 days estimateswe do not use exactly a 30 days estimate but a little bit less for the gold volatility.
