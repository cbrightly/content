This chart compares the volatility of Bitcoin prices with gold. Volatility is the magnitude of variation of the price of a financial asset. It gives a measure of the risk of investing in Bitcoin.
We calculate it as the standard deviation of log returns of the preceding 30 days' close price.

As sources we use the the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) for the gold price, and, of course, the Kaiko Bitcoin Price Index for the Bitcoin price.
As the classical markets are closed on weekends and holidays, we do not use exactly a 30 days estimate but a little bit less for the gold volatility.
