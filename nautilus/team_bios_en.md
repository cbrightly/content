## The Kaiko Team

### Pascal Gauthier

__Co-founder & CEO__

Pascal brings to Challenger Deep his energy and experience from a 15+ year career in digital media and advertising technology. He is now committing his resources to the next big digital revolution.

He led sales teams at price comparison service Kelkoo (both before and after its acquisition by Yahoo in 2004) becoming Commercial Director of Kelkoo sales for cars, travel and shopping.

In early 2008 he moved on to a sales and marketing position at Criteo, and was swiftly promoted to COO after playing an instrumental role in pivoting that company towards advertising. Criteo (CRTO) is now public, listed on Nasdaq with a $3bn+ market cap.

He currently sits on the boards of two promising ad-tech companies: Teads.tv and OpenX.

After discovering bitcoin while serving as entrepreneur-in-residence at Index Ventures in 2014, Pascal realized this groundbreaking new technology can only prosper if all users have access to reliable security and useful information. With this in mind, he founded a company with a goal to be bitcoin's ultimate data provider: Challenger Deep.

Pascal is also a board member of secure bitcoin hardware wallet maker Ledger, and has invested in African remittance service BitPesa. He is a strong believer in bitcoin's potential as an asset, promising it will be "huge in Africa", and that "remittance is likely to be one of bitcoin's killer apps".


### Vincent de Lagabbe
__Co-founder & CTO__

Prior to Kaiko, Vincent worked at Criteo for nearly five years, beginning as a software developer and moving quickly up to leadership positions, first on the publisher integration team then on everything related to mobile.

Earlier in his career, he worked in the defence industry sector as a critical systems engineer.

Vincent's experience building large complex systems, at scale, is perfect for the task of building an all-encompassing data source for the bitcoin industry.


### Stanislas Marion
__Lead Developer__

Stan is an entrepreneur and talented software engineer with an intimate knowledge of bitcoin and its inner workings. He works on Kaiko's backend implementing parsing, data aggregation and live syncing, and indexing of the bitcoin blockchain and markets.

He founded online content summarizer tool tldr.io, which was incubated at Seedcamp London and eventually sold.

He has also worked on other fintech-related projects including as CTO on the Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading Experiment (an experimental high-frequency trading platform), building a system to ease sending of bank wires, and as a consultant to artificial intelligence enterprise software company Yseop.

Stan holds a BS in Mathematics from Centrale Paris and a MS in Management Science and Engineering form Stanford University. He is also a great poker player and curates the widely-read BitcoinWeekly newsletter.


### Arnaud Drizard
__Software Engineer__

Arnaud become gradually interested in bitcoin over the past few years, drawn to its peer-to-peer nature and potential for allowing machine transactions in an automated future.

He has plenty of experience in startups in related industries, co-founding group payments company Twinkler and holding development positions at eFounders and Rocket Internet.

Arnaud combines Masters degrees in both Management and Quantitative Economics & Finance with a degree in Engineering to provide Challenger Deep with invaluable perspectives on the digital currency industry as it grows to challenge existing paradigms.
