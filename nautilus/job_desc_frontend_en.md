__Kaiko is building a platform that enables business and people around the world to understand and build products and services on top of the Bitcoin protocol. We take great pride in our work, and identify strongly with the following characteristics:__

- __End-to-end ownership of your products.__ For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done
- __We ship features as early as possible.__ We move fast and typically deploy new features of bug fixes multiple times a day
- __Job well done attitude.__ We strive for high quality. It is not enough to just do the job. We maintain a lot of organizational freedom thanks to this principle.
