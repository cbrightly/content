##What are 'Altcoins'?##

To put it simply: the word 'altcoin' usually refers to any cryptocurrency network that is not bitcoin. With over 90% of the total cryptocurrency value worldwide, bitcoin still dominates the landscape.

But beyond that, the differences between various altcoin projects is vast. Some are virtual copies of bitcoin with different names. Others may use different hashing algorithms, have varying degrees of centralization, incorporate features like shares and smart contracts, or have a specific ideological or economic purpose. At the other end of the scale, some altcoins are designed to be non-serious or may be outright investment scams. 

There are over 400 altcoins in existence today. Most of them are traded on multi-cryptocurrency exchanges like Poloniex, though several major bitcoin exchanges feature a few select altcoins on their platform. Altcoin value also tends to be volatile, even when compared to bitcoin, and lower usage overall means their markets are less liquid. Some small, independent merchants accept various altcoins as payment but (to date) no major retailer has joined in.

Note: Some involved with other cryptocurrencies regard the word 'altcoin' as a pejorative that diminishes the importance of non-bitcoin projects and throws worthwhile objectives into the same basket as scams and jokes. So far, however, there is no one word that easily encapsulates everything happening in this rich field of research.

###Ethereum###

Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and officially launched in July 2015. It is designed with a more 'Turing-complete' programming language than bitcoin, to enable smart contracts and [distributed applications](http://www.coindesk.com/7-cool-decentralized-apps-built-ethereum/) as well as currency transactions. 

Ethereum features a native currency unit called ether (ETH) which is traded on several popular exchanges alongside bitcoin. In early 2016, the first mobile ether wallet launched and the project has featured in experiments by major corporations such as Microsoft and UBS. This increased attention saw the ETH value rise, sometimes replacing litecoin as the second-highest market cap in cryptocurrency. 


###Litecoin###

Litecoin was invented by Charles Lee in October 2011, in his own words, to be the "silver to bitcoin's gold". Though similar to bitcoin in structure, litecoin blocks are mined approximately every 2.5 minutes – meaning transactions are confirmed much faster.

Litecoin's market cap has often occupied the #2 position* (after bitcoin), and it is the only cryptocurrency besides bitcoin to reach a double figure value in USD per coin. At its peak in December 2013, litecoin's market cap was over USD$768.7 million.  

Litecoin is mined using a cryptographic algorithm called Scrypt, a proof-of-work mechanism designed to be memory-heavy and which thus discourages the use of ASIC chips (which in turn decentralizes mining by making it more accessible to small operators). Some litecoin ASIC machines have been developed, however LTC's lower price since 2014 has made their use prohibitively expensive.

Some also claim that litecoin is "not regarded as an altcoin in China". While it is not accepted widely by merchants, LTC is used as a trading currency on large Chinese exchanges and remains popular with speculators.


\* Another network – Ripple and its native currency XRP – often occupies the second spot in market cap. This is slightly misleading as all XRP are already in existence, whereas litecoin (and others) are mined slowly over a period of time.
